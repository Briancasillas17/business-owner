# business-owner



AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business







 Project Description
The Employee Tracker is a command line application that allows the user to manipulate data in a SQL database. 
The app is designed to interact with 3 SQL databases: one called "employees," one called "roles," and one called "departments."
Each employee has a "title" that is a member of the "roles" database, and each role is associated with a member of the "departments" database.





  Usage 

  To use this the user will run the server within the console and select which prompts to use. See walktrough video for more
